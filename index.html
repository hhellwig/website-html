        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am originally from South Jordan, Utah. I am 20 years old and majoring 
          in Nutritional Science at BYU. I am also minoring in Computer Science.
          I got married in August 2022 to my husband, Tyler Porter. Some of my 
          favorite things to do include running, cooking, rock-climbing, reading,
          and writing. In 5 years I hope to have my degree from BYU, be a mom,
          and maybe go on to become a registered dietitian. The picture of me
          above was taken in San Diego, California, at the USS Midway Museum.
